Subterfuge: A pixel game where you fend off ships and subs in your own stealth sub.
The game ends when you lose.
The game is played through the periscope that lets the view move on the z and rotate.
The sub is vulnerable to ships when it surfaces.
The sub is vulnerable to subs when it dives.
Vessels can't be seen until the sub points towards them.
The closer the vessel, the greater the chance of detection and danger.
Works like classic arcades (indefinite shooter)
Examples:
- Galaga
- 1942.
Uses points and score system.
0-500m is the surface and sub sniper zone
600-1100m is the sub zone
1100-1500m is the twilight zone
